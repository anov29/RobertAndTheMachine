Robert and the Machine is a self generating musical piece using Max/MSP. 
It works as a modified drum machine - playing drum samples at a given probability. Those drum samples are then
recorded into a buffer, which applies various audio effects. By controling the amplitude of the acoustic and electronic samples,
an overall shape is formed.
