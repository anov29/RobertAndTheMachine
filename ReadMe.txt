Robert and the Machine is a self generating piece based off the code written in a Max patch provided. 
It works as a modified drum machine, playing drum samples at a given probability. Those drum samples are then
recorded in a buffer which has various audio effects applied. By controling the amplitude of the acoustic and electronic samples,
an overall shape is formed.
